This repository is my hands-on collection of Python scripts, mini-projects, and cloud automation tools that reflect my learning journey and real-world use cases as a DevOps and Cloud Engineer.

This repo includes beginner to intermediate-level Python exercises as well as practical scripts focused on AWS automation using Boto3.


## üìå Key Technologies

## üöÄ Getting Started

To run a project:

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/djcloudking/python-projects.git
cd python-projects

# Navigate to any folder and run the script
python filename.py
```

Some scripts may require environment variables or AWS credentials. Use an `.env` file or `export` commands accordingly.
